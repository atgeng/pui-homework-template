            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>As a project manager for re:Bloom, an organization that provides minority small business owners with affordable digital solutions, I oversaw a team of two developers to develop a website for Emmanuelle Wambach, a ceramicist and small business owner.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Problem -->
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>The original website for Emmanuelle Ceramics looked very amateur and also lacked information hierarchy. Customers had expressed that they had trouble finding certain information which led to many abandoned carts.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Early Consultations -->
        <div class="container" id="faap">
            <h3>Early Consultations</h3>
            <p>As the PM, I had to first consult with the client to discover her goals for the website. I then set up weekly team meetings with my developers and the client so they can receive feedback for the designs that they created. After conducting research by examining other websites, my developers designed low-fidelity wire frames for desktop for each page of the website.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Refined Wireframes -->
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Refined Wireframes</h3>
            <p>Based off of the feedback that we received when we presented the low-fidelity wire frames to our client, we created the high fidelity wire frame of the website to get an idea of what it would look like with colors and images before building the website on Squarespace.</p>

        <!-- User Testing -->
        <div class="container">
            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>We built the website on Squarespace, a no-code platform that would allow our client to easily maintain her platform. We usertested the website on 10 users. The method for usertesting was a think-aloud protocol, where we had users perform tasks and provide feedback. Based on the user tests and feedback from the client, we iterated on the designs, focusing on text hierarchy and consistency.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Final Website -->
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Final Website</h3>
            <p>Our final website was built and hosted through Squarespace. In addition to the website, we provided our client with a How-To Guide that would help them continue to maintain their website. We also set up and taught our client how to optimize their website presence with SEO tools.</p>

            <h3>Key Insights</h3>
            <p>Through this project, I was able to develop skills in project management and create a fully-functional solution. Specifically, I learned to: </p>            
            <ul>
                <li>Organize meetings and documentation for the project.</li>
                <li>Lead a team of 2 developers, offering instruction and feedback.</li>
                <li>Manage stand-ups and sprints, gaining familiarity with the agile environment.</li>        
            </ul>
            <p>Reflecting on the work, many improvements could be made, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a platform that supports more customization.</li>
                <li>Utilize Squarespace resources to its full potential.</li>
